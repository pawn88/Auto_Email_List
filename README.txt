This is a simply python script on linux

Inside the .py file, insert your gmail's email and password.
Whatever you rename the .py file, you must make sure the .lst and .msg files have the SAME name!

The script.sh search the current directory for .py files and make a list of them.
This list is used to run python on each file.
